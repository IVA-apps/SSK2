# What Is This?
This folder contains extra starter content _ONLY_ available to PRO users.  

+ `_template/` - This is a WIP template I'm putting together to support making games with [Tiled](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/libraries/tiled/) and [Factories](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/libraries/factorymgr/). - Functional, but not really ready yet.  Check back later.
+ `images/` - Common images used in many samples.  You need to copy this into samples that don't have an images folder already.
+ `sounds/` - Common sounds used in many samples.  You need to copy this into samples that don't have an images folder already.
+ `toys/` - Experiments I made using SSK2.
+ `wip/` - Work In Progress libraries, games, whatever.

While this content is highly functional, everything you find here is:

* Only documented internally.
* Experimental or something I made for fun.
* Not guaranteed to be universal solutions. 


# How Do I Run It?

1. Copy SSK2 into the sample you want to run and run it. 
2. If folder does not already have `images/` folder, copy the `extras/images/` folder into the sample.
3. If folder does not already have `sounds/` folder, copy the `extras/sounds/` folder into the sample.
4. Run it.
