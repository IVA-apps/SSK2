# What Is This?
This folder contains extra starter content _ONLY_ available to PRO users.  

+ `_blanks/` - These are blank projects I use to make samples and starter games.
+ `factories/` - Common images used in many samples.  You need to copy this into samples that don't have an images folder already.
+ `images/` - Common images used in many samples.  You need to copy this into samples that don't have an images folder already.
+ `sounds/` - Common sounds used in many samples.  You need to copy this into samples that don't have an images folder already.
+ `toys/` - Experiments I made using SSK2.

While this content is highly functional, everything you find here is:

* Only documented internally.
* Experimental or something I made for fun.
* Not guaranteed to be universal solutions. 


# How Do I Run It?
Every _project_ has its own readMe.txt file.  Follow the directions in that file.

# License
You can use this stuff to make your own games and apps, but you CANNOT distribute and/or sell the code.

# Can I get help changing this?
Maybe.  You can contact me for a paid gig and I'll consider it based on what you want to do and my availability.
